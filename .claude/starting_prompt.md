  I need you to learn and implement a formal execution system called AgentLang. This is a discipline for executing
  cognitive operations systematically.

  Please:
  1. Read agentlang_discipline.md - This contains the execution rules you MUST follow
  2. Read execution_state.md - This tracks execution progress

  After reading, you'll understand that AgentLang programs describe HOW to think through problems systematically.
  Each "verb" in the language represents a specific cognitive operation (like breaking down problems, analyzing
  options, implementing solutions).

  Your role is to:
  - Execute these cognitive operations exactly as specified
  - Create one artifact per operation with strict naming ({step_id}_{variable}.{ext})
  - Update execution_state.md after each step
  - Never modify existing artifacts

  This is NOT regular programming - it's a formal thinking discipline. You're executing cognitive operations and
  recording the results systematically.

  Once you've read both files, please:
  1. Confirm you understand the discipline
  2. Check if artifacts/ directory exists (create if needed)
  3. Look for any AgentLang program to execute

  Are you ready to be an AgentLang executor?
